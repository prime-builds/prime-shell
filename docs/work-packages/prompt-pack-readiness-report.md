All required Stage 3 checks pass after the focused corrections recorded in
section 10. The prompt pack contains the exact six Stage 1 foundation documents
and fourteen approved-provisional prompts, has one acyclic dependency graph,
preserves one primary owner per major boundary, and contains no unresolved
cross-package conflict. This status authorizes only Chat Session review of this
Stage 3 result. It does not create or authorize a pull request, activation,
implementation, merge, publication, rollout, or Stage 4 action.

## 2. Stage completion summary

| Stage | Result | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 foundation | Implemented and accepted | One accepted foundation commit, six Markdown documents |
| Stage 2 package-prompt authoring | Implemented and accepted | Fourteen approved-provisional prompts plus the accepted P3-WP01 focused correction and P6-WP01 artifact-only correction |
| Stage 3 consistency review | Implemented | Full inventory, graph, ownership, semantic, lifecycle, activation, model, gate, naming, hashing, history, and artifact review |
| Stage 4 documentation PR | Not started | Separate Chat Session acceptance and authority are required |

No package after WP01 has been activated or implemented. The documentation
branch remains planning and review material only.

## 3. Reviewed inventory

The six Stage 1 foundation documents are:

1. `docs/work-packages/roadmap-index.md`
2. `docs/work-packages/prompt-authoring-template.md`
3. `docs/work-packages/shared-ground-rules.md`
4. `docs/work-packages/review-checklist.md`
5. `docs/work-packages/activation-procedure.md`
6. `docs/work-packages/dependency-matrix.md`

The package inventory contains exactly fourteen prompt files and no extra or
missing package prompt. The `Stage 2 accepted` identity records the accepted
authoring or correction state before Stage 3. The `Stage 3 reviewed` identity
records the final bytes reviewed in this task; six prompts have new identities
only because Stage 3 added their authority-determined direct-dependent field.

Every Stage 2 accepted blob and SHA-256 was reconciled with its final accepted
authoring handoff before applying Stage 3 corrections. The P6-WP01
artifact-only correction did not change its prompt bytes or Git history.

## 4. Dependency graph

The graph was reconstructed from `dependency-matrix.md`, then cross-checked
against `roadmap-index.md` and each prompt's dependency section.

```text
Accepted WP01
  → GFD-P0B-WP02
  → GFD-P0B-WP03
  → GFD-P1-WP01
  → GFD-P2-WP01
  → GFD-P2-WP02
  → GFD-P3-WP01
  → GFD-P3-WP02
  → GFD-P4-WP01
  → GFD-P5-WP01
  → GFD-P6-WP01
  → GFD-P6-WP02
  → GFD-P7-WP01
  → GFD-P7-WP02
  → GFD-P8-WP01
```

`GFD-P4-WP01` also retains the required supplemental
`GFD-P2-WP02 → GFD-P4-WP01` shell edge. The primary activation sequence remains
linear.

Validation method:

- parsed fourteen matrix rows and fourteen prompt files;
- resolved every package prerequisite and dependent;
- treated accepted WP01 as the one external predecessor;
- required `None` only for P8-WP01;
- built fourteen package edges plus the WP01 root edge;
- ran Kahn topological sorting;
- required all fourteen package nodes exactly once in the roadmap order.

Result: `Passed`. The graph is acyclic, complete, and topologically ordered.
Every primary direct edge is bidirectionally represented by the predecessor's
dependent and successor's prerequisite. The supplemental P2-WP02 shell edge
does not change the controlled linear activation order. No gate requires an
unimplemented successor, and package-level parallel implementation is
prohibited.

## 5. Primary ownership and transition matrix

| Major boundary | Primary owner | Transition and conflict result |
|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle, fault, cancellation, restart/circuit, process spike | `GFD-P0B-WP02` | Proves bounded behavior; P3-WP02 later productizes it without replaying the spike |
| Cross-platform spike closure and evidence classification | `GFD-P0B-WP03` | Closes Phase 0B; does not claim later product or signing behavior |
| Repository, toolchain, contract-drift, CSP/capability baseline | `GFD-P1-WP01` | Reconciles accepted spike evidence; does not implement later UI/backend/release packages |
| Theme, semantic tokens, material, forced colors, accessibility foundation | `GFD-P2-WP01` | Precedes shell composition; no premature shared UI package |
| Responsive shell, title-bar adapters, bounded layout persistence | `GFD-P2-WP02` | Owns only narrow layout preferences; P6-WP01 later owns comprehensive durable settings |
| Native operation, file intent, schema, Rust authorization boundary | `GFD-P3-WP01` | Feature packages consume finite contracts; no generic filesystem/process tunnel |
| Productized task runtime, sidecar lifecycle, no replay, process containment | `GFD-P3-WP02` | Productizes P0B evidence under P3-WP01 authority; no duplicate runtime |
| First document-analysis reference feature | `GFD-P4-WP01` | Consumes shell and P3 boundaries; records friction instead of extracting speculative APIs |
| Second feature and proven static contribution contracts | `GFD-P5-WP01` | Implements the second consumer before minimal extraction; no public SDK or `packages/ui` |
| Settings schema, migrations, atomic writes, recovery, single instance | `GFD-P6-WP01` | Consolidates P2 layout and P4/P5 settings under one Rust writer |
| Diagnostics, export, targeted repair, backend recovery | `GFD-P6-WP02` | Adds bounded allowlisted diagnostics and repair without raw paths, telemetry, or replay |
| Production security, dependency closure, SBOM/licenses, unsigned artifacts | `GFD-P7-WP01` | Hardens unsigned candidates; excludes credentials, signing, updater, and publication |
| Signing, notarization, protected credentials, signed updates/channels | `GFD-P7-WP02` | Separates app/updater roots and staging from publication; no public rollout |
| Evidence-backed template extraction and second branded application | `GFD-P8-WP01` | Extracts only two-application invariants; preserves per-app identity/state/trust and does not reopen signing or publication |

Allowed paths remain activation-time facts. Sequential prompts may touch a
shared area only through the explicit transitions above. No incompatible
expected-path ownership, second writer, duplicated runtime, speculative public
surface, or release-ownership conflict remains.

## 6. Cross-package semantic consistency

| Review dimension | Result | Reconciled invariant |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture and trust | Passed | React is least-trusted presentation; Rust owns native authorization, paths, settings writes, diagnostics export, process lifecycle, single instance, updater verification, and privileged decisions; Python is trusted first-party computation rather than a sandbox or caller-selected script host |
| Generic-tunnel exclusion | Passed | No generic filesystem, process, shell, protocol, environment, path, URL, capability, payload, script, or dynamic-plugin tunnel is authorized |
| Path and opaque-reference secrecy | Passed | Native paths and backing values remain outside React, logs, screenshots, diagnostics, exports, and handoffs |
| Lifecycle and concurrency | Passed | Frames, queues, logs, requests, progress, files, tasks, restarts, and process trees remain bounded |
| Terminal and recovery semantics | Passed | Deterministic terminal precedence, cancellation/timeout/crash handling, one bounded restart/circuit, zero descendants, and no automatic uncertain-work replay remain compatible |
| Settings and data | Passed | P2 layout persistence transitions to one P6 Rust-owned schema, writer, migration, atomic-recovery, and single-instance authority |
| Diagnostics and privacy | Passed | P6 preview-before-export, bounded retention, allowlisted records, path secrecy, targeted repair, unrelated-section preservation, and no telemetry/enterprise support remain intact |
| UI and accessibility | Passed | Fluent v9, semantic tokens, Griffel/release CSP, theme-before-paint, forced colors, reduced effects, keyboard/focus, compact behavior, RTL, text expansion, and 200% scaling remain compatible |
| Platform evidence | Passed | Windows 11 x64/WebView2, activated macOS arm64/WKWebView, and Ubuntu 24.04 x64/WebKitGTK evidence remain independent; Linux package scope remains `.deb` |
| Production and release | Passed | P7-WP01 owns unsigned hardening; P7-WP02 separately owns credentialed signing/notarization/updater mechanics; cryptographic, notarization, Gatekeeper, and reputation claims are not conflated |
| Channels and publication | Passed | Stable/beta trust and metadata are isolated; non-public staging does not authorize public publication, stores, deployment, or rollout |
| Extraction and second app | Passed | P5 requires two feature consumers before internal contribution extraction; P8 requires a real second application and keeps brands, identities, state, operations, capabilities, credentials, channels, packages, and uninstall behavior independent |

No prompt silently amends frozen architecture. Every permitted future targeted
amendment remains an activation-time fact requiring separate acceptance.

## 7. Acceptance-gate and stop-condition review

| Package | Ordered future steps | Measurable future gates | Review result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `GFD-P0B-WP02` | 15 | 15 | Passed |
| `GFD-P0B-WP03` | 18 | 16 | Passed |
| `GFD-P1-WP01` | 14 | 14 | Passed |
| `GFD-P2-WP01` | 16 | 19 | Passed |
| `GFD-P2-WP02` | 20 | 20 | Passed |
| `GFD-P3-WP01` | 20 | 23 | Passed |
| `GFD-P3-WP02` | 24 | 27 | Passed |
| `GFD-P4-WP01` | 23 | 24 | Passed |
| `GFD-P5-WP01` | 23 | 25 | Passed |
| `GFD-P6-WP01` | 24 | 27 | Passed |
| `GFD-P6-WP02` | 21 | 26 | Passed |
| `GFD-P7-WP01` | 25 | 29 | Passed |
| `GFD-P7-WP02` | 25 | 30 | Passed |
| `GFD-P8-WP01` | 25 | 30 | Passed |

All 325 gates are sequential, evidence-measurable, and limited to accepted
predecessors plus the owning package's future work. No gate requires a
successor. Target, security, privacy, lifecycle, artifact, native/manual, and
unavailable evidence remain separately classified. Stop conditions cover
stale activation, authority or repository drift, scope/path expansion,
non-fast-forward state, missing evidence, and inability to prove required
native or manual outcomes. Completion controls cannot imply activation, PR,
merge, publication, rollout, or successor authority.

## 8. Model proportionality

Roadmap, matrix, and prompt fields agree exactly.

| Minimum future model/reasoning | Packages | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `GPT-5.6 Sol / Extra High` | `GFD-P0B-WP02`, `GFD-P0B-WP03`, `GFD-P3-WP01`, `GFD-P3-WP02`, `GFD-P6-WP02`, `GFD-P7-WP01`, `GFD-P7-WP02` | Passed |
| `GPT-5.6 Sol / High` | `GFD-P1-WP01`, `GFD-P2-WP01`, `GFD-P2-WP02`, `GFD-P4-WP01`, `GFD-P5-WP01`, `GFD-P6-WP01`, `GFD-P8-WP01` | Passed |

The Stage 3 review's selected Extra High setting does not raise the stored
future minimum for bounded High packages.

## 9. Structure, lifecycle, activation, vocabulary, and artifacts

| Check | Actual result |
|---|---|
| Prompt structure | Fourteen prompts; exactly eighteen numbered top-level sections in each, once and in order |
| Unresolved placeholders | No `TBD` or `FIXME` |
| Markdown | Balanced fences, valid relative links, no whitespace errors |
| Lifecycle | Every prompt is `Provisional` with implementation `Not started` and execution not authorized |
| Activation | Every prompt requires later Chat Session activation, exact current `main`, a fresh implementation branch, refreshed predecessor/path/tool/platform facts, and explicit invalidation |
| Status vocabulary | Approved implementation and explicitly labeled evidence vocabularies remain separated |
| Future run IDs | Exactly one task-start UTC run ID per future package; exactly four filename occurrences per prompt |
| Future deliverables | Exactly four per package: one source snapshot, one package-specific report, one review evidence index, and one handoff manifest |
| Filename uniqueness | 56 required future filenames, all package-specific and unique across the pack |
| Extra artifacts | No fifth required file, installer/SBOM/secret/native-capture/publication bundle, or publication artifact |
| Manifest hashing | Conditional early prompts require a reproducible convention if a manifest contains its own digest; corrected P3-WP01 onward use the exact single-field `<SELF_SHA256>` convention; the accepted P6-WP01 artifact-only correction and all later prompts explicitly use the literal token |
| Branch controls | Fresh package branches only after activation; ordinary fast-forward publication; no inferred PR, auto-merge, merge, deletion, or publication authority |

`activation-procedure.md` is compatible with every prompt. Stage 3 did not fill
or speculate about future activation values.

## 10. Exact Stage 3 corrections and revalidation

### 10.1 Roadmap status-truth correction

Path: `docs/work-packages/roadmap-index.md`

- Before: `Package prompts do not exist yet and may be authored only through the controlled Stage 2 workflow.`
- After: records that prompts did not exist at Stage 1 acceptance, that all
  fourteen were subsequently authored only through Stage 2, and that they
  remain provisional and non-executable.

This changes no package, order, title, scope, ownership, model, prerequisite,
dependent, architecture, or implementation requirement.

### 10.2 Explicit direct-dependent parity

The following authority-determined fields were added to section 4:

| Prompt | Added direct dependent |
|---|---|
| `GFD-P0B-WP02` | `GFD-P0B-WP03` |
| `GFD-P0B-WP03` | `GFD-P1-WP01` |
| `GFD-P1-WP01` | `GFD-P2-WP01` |
| `GFD-P2-WP01` | `GFD-P2-WP02` |
| `GFD-P2-WP02` | `GFD-P3-WP01` |
| `GFD-P3-WP01` | `GFD-P3-WP02` |

These fields copy the already accepted roadmap/matrix sequence and introduce
no new dependency or scope. The later eight prompts already stated their
direct dependent explicitly.

### 10.3 Rerun result

Each corrected prompt was reread and revalidated completely. Pack-wide
inventory, identity, model, graph/topology, ownership, semantic, lifecycle,
activation, gate, filename, hashing, Markdown, link, whitespace, and history
checks were then rerun. Result: `Passed`.

No other correction was made.

## 11. History and accepted-artifact review

| Stage 1 history | One foundation commit: `cf2c2613d1facca1e61ba03eab88078a0fc1ffbf` |
| Prompt authoring history | Fourteen package-specific authoring commits |
| P3-WP01 correction | Separately identifiable at `6d880bc6cc95489f84c09ddb76ec60497a3583d5` |
| P6-WP01 artifact correction | External-only; prompt blob and Git history unchanged |
| Stage 2 lineage | Linear, ordinary fast-forward history from `main`; 16 commits ahead, 0 behind at Stage 3 start |
| Accepted prompt identity | Every Stage 2 accepted blob and SHA-256 matched its final accepted handoff before Stage 3 corrections |
| Silent amendments | None before this explicitly recorded Stage 3 correction |
| Pull request state | No PR for `docs/gfd-work-package-prompt-pack-v1`, including no closed-but-unmerged PR for that branch |

Accepted-artifact limitation: the P7-WP01 authoring handoff records `67,430`
prompt bytes, while Git object `478f4ae5c44db9ce8e95437a95cdfa3c6901516e`
and the reviewed file are `67,428` bytes. The handoff's blob ID and SHA-256
`c33eae1a6bc1407f4d6b201010342b5ab6e075279ad0e60d580fe7978059e819`
match the repository exactly, so prompt identity, content, scope, and readiness
are reconciled. The two-byte descriptive metadata discrepancy is retained as
an accepted non-blocking limitation because Stage 3 does not rewrite prior
external handoff artifacts.

## 12. Conflicts, limitations, and blockers

| Classification | Result |
|---|---|
| Unresolved cross-package conflicts | `None` |
| Architecture or ownership blockers | `None` |
| Activation blockers introduced by the pack | `None`; each prompt remains intentionally unactivated |
| Accepted artifact limitation | P7-WP01 handoff byte-count metadata differs by two bytes; cryptographic identity matches, as detailed in section 11 |
| Environment limitation | Standard `gh` publishing helper is unavailable; this does not affect the repository review and any authorized branch update must use the already connected non-force Git-data path |

No limitation weakens the prompt-pack dependency, ownership, architecture,
lifecycle, security, privacy, platform, model, activation, or evidence result.

## 13. Truthful status inventory

```text
Stage 1 foundation: Implemented and accepted
Stage 2 package-prompt authoring: Implemented and accepted
Approved-provisional prompt count: 14
Package activations after WP01: Not started
Package implementations after WP01: Not started
Stage 3 cross-package consistency review: Implemented
Prompt-pack readiness report: Implemented
Narrow Stage 3 corrections: Implemented
Unresolved cross-package conflicts: Not started
Stage 4 documentation PR: Not started
Prompt-pack merge: Not started
Documentation branch deletion: Not started
GFD-P0B-WP02 activation: Not started
Application implementation: Not started
Signing/notarization/updater execution: Not started
Public publication/customer rollout: Not started
Product/customer work: Not started
Repository-setting changes: Not started
```

All fourteen package prompts remain provisional, non-executable, unactivated,
and unimplemented. Prompt acceptance remains separate from activation;
activation remains separate from implementation; implementation review remains
separate from PR, merge, credential, signing, updater, publication, and rollout
authority.

## 14. Unchanged scope and next controlled action

Stage 3 changed only prompt-pack documentation. It did not change application
source, Phase 0A, repository authority, schemas, dependencies, lockfiles,
workflows, tests, packages, release configuration, credentials, external
services, repository settings, or `main`. It did not create a PR, enable
auto-merge, merge, delete a branch, activate or implement a package, begin
Stage 4, sign or publish software, create a second application, or begin
customer/product work.

The exact next controlled action is Chat Session review of the final Stage 3
commit, this readiness report, and the three Stage 3 handoff artifacts. A
documentation PR may be considered only in a later separately authorized
Stage 4 action after Chat Session accepts Stage 3.
